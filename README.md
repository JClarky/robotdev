# Robot Development 2021
Robot development repo

Only edit files in main folder. Use deploy.exe to build and deploy to git.

The robot has to build and compile the code itself as my linux will not build 32 bit for some reason :(
Windows simulator also has to build itself for OS incompatability.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Run deploy_windows first then run build_sim
