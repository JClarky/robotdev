# Robot Development 2021
Robot development repo

Only edits files in main folder. Use deploy.exe to build and deploy to git.

The robot has to build and compile the code itself as linux will not build 32 bit for some reason :(
Windows simulatior also has to build itself for OS incompatability.

/main folder contains all raw code

/robot folder contains ONLY robot code, this folder should be deployed to!

/simulation contains ONLY simulation code, this folder should be deployed to!
